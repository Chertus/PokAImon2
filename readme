AI-Powered Pokemon Trainer Project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI bot that learns to play the game "Pokemon Red" effectively. The bot will use reinforcement learning (RL) to master various aspects of the game, including battling, catching Pokemon, and completing the game. The project involves capturing game state data, processing it, and using it to train the AI model.
